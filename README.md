# Budget App

This is the third project out of five that I completed as part of the 'Scientific Computing with Python' course from freeCodeCamp. For this project, I worked on Replit using their test code to develop a function. This project involves creating a 'Category' class that allows object instantiation for various budget categories like food, clothing and entertainment. The class includes methods for deposit, withdraw, balance, transfer and checking funds. Additionally, there's a bar chart that is generated showing the percentage spent in each category.
